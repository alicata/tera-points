# tera-points
Research into billion/trillion point renderer from depth / LiDAR sensors data

## goal
Create a cleaner and easier to hack research source in GPU accelerated sensor point cloud rendering.

## additonal credit
The starting point of this code base is a rewrite of the original https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01287. 
Sub-project compute_2G_points is focused on billion points, but future version might target trillion points.
